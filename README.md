# azure-monitor-alert-listener

**azure-monitor-alert-listener** is a lightweight application developed to test and handle incoming alerts from **Azure Monitor**, specifically for **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**.  
It acts as a simple **Webhook endpoint** that listens for alert notifications using the [Azure Monitor Common Alert Schema](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-common-schema).

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This project was built to:
- Simulate a Webhook endpoint to receive alerts from Azure Monitor
- Debug and inspect ADF alert payloads in real-time
- Experiment with binding alert data to templates or forwarding to other systems (e.g., email, message queue)

## ðŸš€ Features

- HTTP POST endpoint (`/alert`) to receive alerts
- JSON schema parsing based on Azure Monitor Common Alert Schema
- Logging / inspection of alert details (e.g. alertRule, severity, firedDateTime)
- Designed to integrate with email or notification systems (coming soon)

## ðŸ§± Technology Stack

- [Rust ðŸ¦€](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [actix-web](https://actix.rs/) â€“ Web framework
- [serde](https://docs.rs/serde) â€“ JSON deserialization
- [tera](https://tera.netlify.app/) â€“ Optional HTML templating


## ðŸ“« How It Works

1. Azure Monitor triggers an alert
2. The alert is sent as an HTTP POST to this app (e.g. `http://your-server/alert`)
3. The app parses the JSON and logs / processes it
4. (Optional) Alert content is rendered into HTML or forwarded elsewhere

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```
